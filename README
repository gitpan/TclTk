This is the beta1 release of the Tcl::Tk extension module for Perl5. You
need to have at least release 5.001 of Perl because the installation
of this extension uses features of ExtUtils::MakeMaker which only work
properly as of that release. You also need the Tcl extension.

The Tcl::Tk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
version of Tk) provides a raw but complete interface to the whole of
Tk via the Tcl extension.
