This is the beta2 release of the Tcl::Tk extension module for Perl5. You
need to have at least release 5.002 of Perl and you need to have installed
the Tcl extension already.

The Tcl::Tk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
Perl/Tk extension) provides a raw but complete interface to the whole
of Tk via the Tcl extension.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary--if your Tcl or Tk include files
are neither in /usr/local/include nor in /usr/include/tcl then put
the appropriate path in the INC line. If your Tk libraries are not
found by default then add the appropriate -L options to the LIBS line.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install
