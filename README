The Tcl::Tk extension (not to be confused with the "native" perl5
Perl/Tk extension) provides a raw but complete interface to the whole
of Tk via the Tcl extension.

Build in the usual way for a perl extension:

1. Tweak Makefile.PL is necessary only if your Tcl or Tk include files could
not be found automatically by Makefile.PL script. Normally you just make
sure you have right tcl/tk in your path at a moment of running Makefile.PL
script.

2. perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make install
